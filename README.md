# PLTS_toolkit
This toolkit provides an interactive interface for constructing and visualising paraconsistent labelled transition systems (PLTS). Users can define arbitrary lattices, generate their associated twist structures, build PLTS, and evaluate formulas of the paraconsistent modal logic on the constructed PLTS.
